🚀 Py++ Programming Language (Source Code)

Py++ is an experimental programming language project designed to blend the simplicity of Python with the performance mindset of C/C++.

This repository contains the core source code of Py++, including early-stage language design, parser/compiler experiments, and internal tooling. The project is open-source, learning-driven, and actively evolving.

🔥 Key Objectives

🧠 Python-like, readable syntax

⚡ High-performance execution (long-term goal)

🧩 Modular architecture (modules & includes planned)

🛠️ Built for learning compiler and language internals

🚧 Early-stage project — breaking changes are expected

📦 What’s Included

Language core source code

Lexer and parser logic

Compiler/interpreter experiments

Internal utilities and helpers

🎯 Purpose

Most languages trade simplicity for speed—or speed for complexity.
Py++ exists to challenge that trade-off.

This project is ideal for:

Learning how programming languages work internally

Experimenting with language and compiler design

Developers interested in low-level + high-level hybrids

🤝 Contributions

Contributions are welcome.
Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or propose ideas.

📜 License

Open-source. Use it, modify it, break it, improve it.

Built with curiosity, discipline, and a bit of chaos.
